The assignment consisted in coding two readers: buffered and unbuffered. The readers were supposed to get the last letter of every word in the dictionary. The number of times each letter from A-Z appeared in said spot was to be recorded and then made into a histogram. Once the coding was done, the efficiency of the buffered program was tested on a hard disk drive (HDD) and on a USB.
